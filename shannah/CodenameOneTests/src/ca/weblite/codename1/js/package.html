        <h1>Codename One JS Bridge</h1>
        
        <p>The Codename One JS Bridge package includes classes that facilitate the
            interaction between Java and Javascript in a Codename One application.
            It allows both Java to Javascript communication and the reverse via a
            mechanism similar to the one employed by Phone Gap/Apache Cordova.</p>
        
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        
        <p>The JavascriptContext class lays the foundation by enabling you to call
            Javascript code directly from Java.  It provides automatic type conversion
            between Java and Javascript types as follows:</p>
        
        <h3>Java to Javascript</h3>
        <table border="1">
            <thead><tr><th>Java Type</th><th>Javascript Type</thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>String</td><td>String</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Double/Integer/Float/Long</td><td>Number</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Boolean</td><td>Boolean</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>JSObject</td><td>Object</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>null</td><td>null</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Other</td><td>Not Allowed</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
         
        <h3>Javascript to Java</h3>
        
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Javascript Type</th><th>Java Type</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Object</td><td>JSObject</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Function</td><td>JSObject</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>null</td><td>null</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>undefined</td><td>null</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p>
            Note that this conversion table is more verbose than necessary, since Javascript functions 
            and arrays are, in fact Objects themselves, so those rows are redundant.  All Javascript
            objects are converted to JSObjects.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        
        <p>In order to start interacting with a Javascript environment, you need to create
            a WebBrowser and load a page.  Then inside the WebBrowser's onLoad() handler, you
            can create a JavascriptContext on the internal BrowserComponent object:</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4512578.js"></script>
        
        <h3>Getting Values</h3>
        
        <p>The JavascriptContext.get() method is used to get values from Javascript.  
            It takes an arbitrary Javascript expression, executes it, and returns the
            result, after converting it to the corresponding Java type.  E.g. if the result
            is a String, it will return a String and if it is a Number it will return a 
            java Double object.  If the result is an Object, it will return a JSObject.</p>
        
        <p>The following is a simple example that retrieves the document content, which
            is a string:</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4512690.js"></script>
        
        <p>If you run this example in the simulator, you'll see something like the following:</p>
        
        <p>
            <center>
                 <img src="http://media.weblite.ca/files/photos/hello-world-cn1.png"/>
            </center>
        </p>
        
        <p>Note:  You don't see the WebBrowser in the background here due to a bug in the simulator.
            If you run this example on a device, you will see the WebBrowser component in the background.</p>
        
        <h4>Returning Numeric Values</h4>
        
        <p>As mentioned in the conversion table above, numeric values are automatically
            converted to java.lang.Double objects.  The following example, returns the width and height
            properties of the window for use in Java.</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4512756.js"></script>
        
        <p>The result, when run in the simulator would be something like:</p>
        
        <p>
            <center><img src="http://media.weblite.ca/files/photos/window-size.png"/></center>
        </p>


        <h4>Returning Objects</h4>
        
        <p>The previous examples involved only primitive return values.  The JavascriptContext abstraction,
            in these cases, doesn't offer a whole lot of added-value over just using the BrowserComponent.executeJavascriptAndReturnString()
            method.  The real value is when we are dealing with objects.</p>
        <p>The following example obtains a reference to the <code>window</code> object and wraps it in a 
            proxy JSObject class so that we can work directly with the window object:</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4512795.js"></script>
        
        <p>This code produces the exact same result as the previous example.  The difference
            is the intermediary step of wrapping the window object in a JSObject, and
            obtaining the outerHeight and outerWidth properties directly via that proxy object.</p>
        
        <p>You can obtain a JSObject proxy for any Javascript object, even ones that you create
            on the fly.  The following example creates an anonymous object with some keys and values
            and uses a JSObject proxy to interact with this object from Java.</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4512841.js"></script>
        
        <p>The result is as follows:</p>
        
        <p><center><img src="http://media.weblite.ca/files/photos/steve-is-34-dialog.png"/></center></p>

        <p>See <a href="#working-with-objects">Working With Objects</a> for more information
            about working with the JSObject class.</p>
        
        <h4>Returning Functions and Arrays</h4>
        
        <p>In Javascript, functions and arrays are just objects, so these are also encapsulated as JSObject
            proxies.  See <a href="#working-with-arrays">Working with Arrays</a> and 
            <a href="#working-with-functions">Workin with Functions</a> for more details on how to work
            with these values via the JSObject interface.</p>
        
        <h3>Setting Values</h3>
        
        <p>Just as you can get values from Javascript using JavascriptContext's get() method, you can
            also set values via JavascriptContext.set().</p>
        
        <p>The following is a simple example that sets the location, and causes it to redirect to
            a different page:</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4512960.js"></script>
        
        
        <p>If you run this example, you should see your browser display the Codename One website after
            a redirect.</p>
        <p><center><img src="http://media.weblite.ca/files/photos/redirect-to-codename1.png"/></center></p>


        <h4>Setting Object Values</h4>
        
        <p>The previous example showed us setting a primitive String value.  You can do the same with other
            primitives like numbers and booleans, but you can also set Object values using the set() method.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following example creates an anonymous Javascript object, wraps it in a JSObject proxy,
            sets some values on it, then sets the object as a property of the top-level window object.</p>
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4513301.js"></script>
        
        <p>As a result, you should see the following content set as the body of the HTML page in the
            WebBrowser.  Note that we can refer to the "steve" object that we just set directly/globally
            because the "window" object's properties are always available directly through the global
            namespace in Javascript.</p>
        <p><center><img src="http://media.weblite.ca/files/photos/steve-is-34.png"/></center></p>

        <h2>Working with Objects</h2>
        
        <p>Previously examples showed how to obtain a JSObject proxy to a Javascript object.  There are 4 ways to get a JSObject:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an anonymous object: <br/><code>JSObject obj = (JSObject)ctx.get("{}");</code></li>
            <li>Reference an existing object directly: <br/><code>JSObject obj = (JSObject)ctx.get("window.location");</code></li>
            <li>As the result of a Javascript expression or function call:
                <br/><code>JSObject obj = (JSObject)ctx.get("document.getElementById('mydiv')")</code>
            </li>
            <li>Retrieve an Object member variable from another JSObject: 
                <br/><code>JSObject obj = (JSObject)otherObj.get("aPropertyThatIsAnObject")</code>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>JSObjects are essentially just proxies around a Javascript object.  Any calls to retrieve 
            properties from a JSObject are just sent directly to the Javascript context, and the result
            returned.  The JSObject object doesn't store copies the javascript object's properties.  It just
            retrieves them as they are required via the get() method.</p>
        
        <h3>Getting Simple Values</h3>
        
        <p>You can always retrieve the properties of an object using the get() method.  It takes the name of the property 
            as a parameter, and returns its value, converted to the appropriate Java type.  (e.g. if it is a String,
            it returns a String, if it is a number it returns a Double, and if it is an Object, it returns an object.</p>
        
        <p>E.g.</p>
        
        <p><code><pre>
String name = (String)obj.get("name");
Double age = (Double)obj.get("age");
</pre></code>
            <br/>
            Is equivalent to the following javascript:
            <br/>
            <code>
                var name = obj.name;
                var age = obj.age;
            </code>
            <br/>
            Assuming that the <code>obj</code> variable in Java is a proxy for the same obj variable
            in the javascript example.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Getting Nested Object Values</h3>
        
        <p>Often, in Javascript, an object contains a heirarchy of nested child objects.  E.g.</p>
        
        <p><code><pre>
var obj = {
    name : 'Steve',
    position : {
        x : 100,
        y : 105,
        z : -25
    }
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>In this case you may want to obtain the <var>x</var> coordinate of the nested position object.  JSObject allows
    you to use the dot '.' notation for referencing sub-properties like this.  E.g. <br/>
    <code><pre>Double x = (Double)obj.get("position.x")</pre></code>
</p>
<p>This feature raises the issue of how, then, to access properties that contain a '.' in its name.  E.g.</p>
<p><code><pre>
var obj = {
    name : 'Steve',
    position : {
        x : 100,
        y : 105,
        z : -25
    },
    'position.x' : 200
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>In this example there is a top-level property named 'position.x' as well as a property at the component address <var>position.x</var>.
    This is a contrived example that is meant to be somewhat confusing in order to demonstrate how to differentiate
    between requests for properties in the child object heirarchy and top-level properties that happen to 
    include a '.' in the property name.</p>

<p>We can force the retrieval of a top-level property by wrapping the <var>key</var> in single quotes:</p>
<p><code><pre>Double x1 = (Double)obj.get("'position.x'")</pre></code></p>

<p>This would return <int>200</int> for the above example, whereas:</p>
<p><code><pre>Double x2 = (Double)obj.get("position.x")</pre></code></p>
<p>Would return <int>100</int></p>.
       
<h3>Setting Object Values</h3>

<p>The <code>JSObject.set()</code> method works the same as the JavascriptContext.set() method except that it treats the local
    object as the root node.  It allows you to easily set properties on the object.  Values set here should
    be provided using Java values as they will automatically be converted to the appropriate associated Javascript
    type.  If you are setting an Object as a value, then you'll need to set it as a JSObject and not a string
    representation of the object.  This is because Strings will just be converted to Javascript strings.</p>

<p>Properties set via the JSObject.set() method modify the underlying Javascript object directly so that the change
    is immediately effective inside the javascript environment.
</p>
<p>Just as with the JSObject.get() method, you can set the values of direct properties or nested properties using
    the dot '.' notation.  And just like JSObject.get(), you can force setting a direct property in cases where the property
    name includes a '.', by wrapping the <var>key</var> inside single quotes.
    
</p>
<p>E.g.:</p>
<p><code><pre>
// Create a team object , and leave city null for now.
JSObject blueJays = (JSObject)ctx.get("{name : 'Blue Jays', city : null}");

// Create a city object and leave country null for now.
JSObject toronto = (JSObject)ctx.get("{name : 'Toronto', country : null}");

// Create a country object
JSObject canada = (JSObject)ctx.get("{name : 'Canada'}");

// Set the team's city to toronto
blueJays.set("city", toronto);

// Set toronto's country to canada
toronto.set("country", canada);

// Retrieve the name of the country where the blue jays play
String countryName = (String)blueJays.get("city.country.name");
       // Should contain "Canada"

// Change the name of Canada to "Canuck land" using nested 
// dot notation on the blueJays object.

blueJays.set("city.country.name", "Canuck land");

String blueJaysCountry = (String)blueJays.get("city.country.name");
String torontoCountry = (String)tornoto.get("country.name");
String canadaName = (String)canada.get("name");

//Note that all of these should be equal and contain "Canuck land"
</pre></code>
        
        <h3>Calling Object Methods</h3>
        
        <p>The JSObject.call() method allows you to call javascript methods that 
            are members of the underlying object.  It arguments are passed as an
            Object[] array.  These will be automatically converted from the Java type to the corresponding
            Javascript type.  Java type conversion are the same as using the set() method.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following example shows an object with a simple <code>add()</code> method
            that just adds two numbers together:</p>
        <p><code><pre>
JSObject obj = (JSObject)ctx.get("{ add : function(a,b){ return a+b;}}");
Double result = (Double)obj.call("add", 
    new Object[]{new Integer(1), new Integer(3)}
);

// Result should be 4.0
</pre></code></p>
               
<h3>Working with Arrays</h3>

<p>In javascript, arrays are just objects that include a special ability to be iterated.  You can use the alternate
    version of JSObject.get() which takes an int as a parameter to retrieve the elements of an array.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following javascript object:</p>
<p><code><pre>
var obj = {
    name : 'Blue Jays',
    players : [
        { name : 'George Bell', age : 31},
        { name : 'Tony Fernandez', age : 34},
        { name : 'Lloyd Moseby', age : 29}
    ]
}

        </pre></code></p>
        
        <p>Then assuming we have a JSObject proxy for this object, we could loop through the players
            array and output the name and age of each player as follows:</p>
        
        <p><code><pre>
JObject players = (JObject)obj.get("players");
int len = ((Double)players.get("length")).intValue();
for ( int i=0; i&lt;len; i++){
    JSObject player = (JSObject)players.get(i);
    Log.p("Name : "+player.get("name")+" age : "+player.get("age"));
}
                </pre></code>
               
            
            
        <h2>Calling Java Methods from Javascript</h2>
        
        <p>So far, our examples have been limited to Java calling into Javascript.  However, it may be 
            useful to be able to also go the other way:  call java methods from Javascript.  Some applications
            of this might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Capturing video, or using the camera on the phone</li>
            <li>Getting the phone location</li>
            <li>Accessing the file system or storage API</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Codename One JS bridge supports javascript to java method calling by way of the JSFunction interface
            and the addCallback() methods on the JSObject and JavascriptContext classes.  You can implement a JSFunction
            object and register it as a callback with a JSObject or JavascriptContext, then you will be able to 
            execute this object's apply method via a Javascript proxy.</p>
        
        <p>As an example, let's implement a simple logging function:</p>
        
        <p><code><pre>
JSObject logger = (JSObject)ctx.get("{}");
logger.addCallback("log", new JSFunction(){

    public void apply(JSObject self, Object[] args) {
        String msg = (String)args[0];
        Log.p("[Javascript Logger] "+msg);
    }
    
});

ctx.set("window.logger", logger);


c.executeAndReturnString("logger.log('This is a test message');");
</pre></code></p>

<p>If you execute this code in the simulator, you'll see the following output in the console:</p>

<pre>[EDT] 0:0:0,0 - [Javascript Logger] This is a test message</pre>

<p>Running it on a device will yield similar output in the device log file.</p>

<p>Let's step through this code to see what is happening.  First we create a new, empty javascript object
    and wrap it in a JSObject proxy.  Then we use the JSObject's addCallback() method to add an anonymous JSFunction
    object to it with the propery of "log".  This step registers a method proxy on the Javascript side that acts just
    like a normal javascript method, but which actually triggers the JSFunction's apply() method.</p>

<p>We then set this <var>logger</var> object to the global javascript scope by making it a direct child
    of the <var>window</var> object.  Finally we issue a Javascript method call to <code>logger.log()</code>.  This 
    is what effectively calls the apply() method on our JSFunction object.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p><strong>JSFunction callbacks are executed asynchronously so as to prevent deadlocks.</strong>  This means that you cannot 
    return a value from this method using a return statement (hence the reason why the interface definition for apply() is <var>void</var>.
</p>
<p><strong>If you want to return a value back to Javascript, then you'll need to do it by providing a 
        callback function as one of the parameters, and call this callback method from inside the apply()
        method upon completion.</strong></p>
