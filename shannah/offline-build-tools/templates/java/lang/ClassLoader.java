/**
 * A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes. The
 * class <tt>ClassLoader</tt> is an abstract class.  Given the <a
 * href="#name">binary name</a> of a class, a class loader should attempt to
 * locate or generate data that constitutes a definition for the class.  A
 * typical strategy is to transform the name into a file name and then read a
 * "class file" of that name from a file system.
 *
 * <p> Every {@link Class <tt>Class</tt>} object contains a {@link
 * Class#getClassLoader() reference} to the <tt>ClassLoader</tt> that defined
 * it.
 *
 * <p> <tt>Class</tt> objects for array classes are not created by class
 * loaders, but are created automatically as required by the Java runtime.
 * The class loader for an array class, as returned by {@link
 * Class#getClassLoader()} is the same as the class loader for its element
 * type; if the element type is a primitive type, then the array class has no
 * class loader.
 *
 * <p> Applications implement subclasses of <tt>ClassLoader</tt> in order to
 * extend the manner in which the Java virtual machine dynamically loads
 * classes.
 *
 * <p> Class loaders may typically be used by security managers to indicate
 * security domains.
 *
 * <p> The <tt>ClassLoader</tt> class uses a delegation model to search for
 * classes and resources.  Each instance of <tt>ClassLoader</tt> has an
 * associated parent class loader.  When requested to find a class or
 * resource, a <tt>ClassLoader</tt> instance will delegate the search for the
 * class or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to find the
 * class or resource itself.  The virtual machine's built-in class loader,
 * called the "bootstrap class loader", does not itself have a parent but may
 * serve as the parent of a <tt>ClassLoader</tt> instance.
 *
 * <p> Normally, the Java virtual machine loads classes from the local file
 * system in a platform-dependent manner.  For example, on UNIX systems, the
 * virtual machine loads classes from the directory defined by the
 * <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable.
 *
 * <p> However, some classes may not originate from a file; they may originate
 * from other sources, such as the network, or they could be constructed by an
 * application.  The method {@link #defineClass(String, byte[], int, int)
 * <tt>defineClass</tt>} converts an array of bytes into an instance of class
 * <tt>Class</tt>. Instances of this newly defined class can be created using
 * {@link Class#newInstance <tt>Class.newInstance</tt>}.
 *
 * <p> The methods and constructors of objects created by a class loader may
 * reference other classes.  To determine the class(es) referred to, the Java
 * virtual machine invokes the {@link #loadClass <tt>loadClass</tt>} method of
 * the class loader that originally created the class.
 *
 * <p> For example, an application could create a network class loader to
 * download class files from a server.  Sample code might look like:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   ClassLoader loader&nbsp;= new NetworkClassLoader(host,&nbsp;port);
 *   Object main&nbsp;= loader.loadClass("Main", true).newInstance();
 *       &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> The network class loader subclass must define the methods {@link
 * #findClass <tt>findClass</tt>} and <tt>loadClassData</tt> to load a class
 * from the network.  Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class,
 * it should use the method {@link #defineClass <tt>defineClass</tt>} to
 * create a class instance.  A sample implementation is:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     class NetworkClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
 *         String host;
 *         int port;
 *
 *         public Class findClass(String name) {
 *             byte[] b = loadClassData(name);
 *             return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
 *         }
 *
 *         private byte[] loadClassData(String name) {
 *             // load the class data from the connection
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h4> <a name="name">Binary names</a> </h4>
 *
 * <p> Any class name provided as a {@link String} parameter to methods in
 * <tt>ClassLoader</tt> must be a binary name as defined by the <a
 * href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/">Java Language Specification</a>.
 *
 * <p> Examples of valid class names include:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *   "java.lang.String"
 *   "javax.swing.JSpinner$DefaultEditor"
 *   "java.security.KeyStore$Builder$FileBuilder$1"
 *   "java.net.URLClassLoader$3$1"
 * </pre></blockquote>
